# Conway's Game of Life with GLFW

This project is a C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life with a modern interactive interface using GLFW and OpenGL.

## Features

- **Infinite grid**: Only living cells are stored, allowing unlimited exploration.
- **Drag & drop navigation**: Move the grid by holding the left mouse button and dragging.
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out, centered on the mouse pointer.
- **Cell editing**:
  - **Right click** to make a cell alive at the cursor position.
- **Simulation control**:
  - **Space bar** to start/stop the simulation.
  - **Backspace** to clear all living cells instantly.
- **Black grid on white background** for clear visibility.
- **Speed control**:
  - Use `+`/`-` (or `=`/`-`) keys on the keyboard or numeric keypad to increase/decrease simulation speed.
  - The current speed and simulation state are now displayed as an overlay inside the window (with a white rectangle for readability).
- **Fullscreen**:
  - `F11` key to toggle fullscreen/windowed mode.
- **Pattern insertion**:
  - Press numeric keypad keys (`Numpad 1` to `Numpad 5`) to insert classic patterns at the mouse position:
    - `Numpad 1`: Glider
    - `Numpad 2`: Blinker
    - `Numpad 3`: Toad
    - `Numpad 4`: Beacon
    - `Numpad 5`: Pulsar
- **On-screen overlay**:
  - Simulation speed and state (Running/Paused) are always visible in the top-left corner, with a white background for readability.

## Requirements
- CMake
- GCC (MinGW on Windows) or any C++17 compiler
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) (automatically downloaded by CMake)

## Build
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
cmake --build .
```

CMake will automatically download and build GLFW for your platform (no need to manually download binaries).

## Run
From the `build` folder:

```sh
./GLFW_Interface
```

## Quick start

### Windows
- Double-click `launch.bat` or run it in a terminal to build and launch the project.

### Linux
- Run `bash launch.sh` in the project folder to build and launch the project.

## Cross-platform compatibility

- The project is tested and works on **Windows**
- I still didn't test it on Linux, but it should work.

## Project structure

- `main.cpp`: entry point, main loop, user interaction
- `GameOfLife.hpp` / `GameOfLife.cpp`: infinite grid logic
- `Renderer.hpp` / `Renderer.cpp`: grid and cell rendering
- `Camera.hpp` / `Camera.cpp`: camera/viewport logic (pan & zoom)
- `Patterns.hpp`: classic patterns (glider, blinker, etc.)
- `stb_easy_font.h`: simple text rendering for overlays
- `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake configuration (uses FetchContent for GLFW)

## Customization

- Change window or cell size in `main.cpp`.
- Improve logic or rendering as you wish.
- Add your own patterns in `Patterns.hpp`.
